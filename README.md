# Java-Class-Generator
"Java Class Generator" is an application which allows you to quickly generate a Java class with the class attributes you want. Below shows more detailed
information regarding the application.

### Executable File

The executable file "java_class_generator.exe" is used to run the application. It is downloadable from 
https://github.com/DtjiSoftwareDeveloper/Java-Class-Generator/blob/main/executable/java_class_generator.exe.

### Source Code

Python code used to create the application is available in 
https://github.com/DtjiSoftwareDeveloper/Java-Class-Generator/blob/main/code/java_class_generator.py.

### Getting Started

Once you run the application, you will be asked whether you want to continue using the application or not. If you enter 'Y', you will be asked to enter
the name of the class, the number of class attributes you want to have in your class, and the visibility level, name, and type for each class attribute.
If you enter anything else, you will exit the application.

Once you finish entering the name of the class, the number of class attributes you want to have in your class, and the visibility level, name, and 
type for each class attribute, a Java class file will be generated and you will also be asked whether you want to continue using the application or not.
